## Inspiration  
With so much happening across the University of Manitoba, students often struggle to stay connected and engaged with campus life. We created `UoM-Social-Media` to bridge that gap, providing a platform where students can share updates, discover community posts, and connect with peers seamlessly.

## How We Built It  
We crafted this project using Django, a robust Python framework, to power the backend and handle user authentication, content management, and API endpoints. For the frontend, we leveraged React paired with Tailwind CSS to deliver a responsive and intuitive user interface. PostgreSQL serves as our database, ensuring reliable and scalable data storage.

## Challenges We Ran Into  
Early on, we grappled with designing a scalable database schema to handle dynamic social media content. Balancing performance with real-time updates was tricky, but switching to PostgreSQL and optimizing our queries helped us overcome this hurdle.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of  
Weâ€™re thrilled to have built a functional prototype that supports core social media featuresâ€”posting, commenting, and user profilesâ€”in a short timeframe. The clean integration of Django and React also stands out as a win for rapid development.

## What We Learned  
This project deepened our understanding of full-stack development, particularly how Djangoâ€™s ORM simplifies backend logic and how Reactâ€™s component-based structure speeds up UI creation. We also learned the importance of responsive design and efficient API design for a smooth user experience.

## What's Next for UoM-Social-Media  
Looking ahead, we aim to elevate the platform by:  
- Adding real-time notifications and messaging features  
- Enhancing user customization options for profiles  
- Implementing advanced search and filtering for posts  
- Improving accessibility and performance based on user feedback
- Including Mistral Ai for better matching systems
